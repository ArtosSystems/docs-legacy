        <h1 id='introduction'>Introduction</h1>
<p>Welcome, to your bridge to Blockchain; Artos. We have developed the Aventus Protocol on behalf of the Aventus Foundation.</p>

<p>Below you will find a general architecture diagram outlining our core services and where data is being processed from the point of entry via our RESTful API. Each of these distinct products makes up the Artos Systems ecosystem and we aim to continue to develop these as our implementation matures.</p>

<p><img src="images/architecture-diagram-aws.png" alt="big" /></p>

<p>As shown in the above architecture diagram our technology stack is built in layers on top of the blockchain and each product serves a purpose to ensure interaction via our endpoints is standardised and familiar for developers.</p>
<h3 id='aventus-protocol'>Aventus Protocol</h3>
<p>The Aventus Protocol is a global open standard for the exchange of tickets built upon the Ethereum blockchain composed of smart contracts that allow for the creation and validation of events, the issuance, sale and distribution of tickets in primary and secondary ticket markets (under parameters designed and customised by inventory holders and event organisers) and the allocation of defined proportions of ticket sale revenue between event organisers, ticket promoters, artists, secondary resellers, etc.</p>
<h3 id='virtue-services'>Virtue Services</h3><h4 id='patient'>Patient</h4>
<p>Patient is a queuing system. A way to manage a large requests that will write to the blockchain. Think of the IMS that sends large amounts of requests to the blockchain, but the blockchain itself is really slow. Patient manages (i.e. queues) the transactions that are being sent to the blockchain. A user of Patient doesn’t need to know how to interact with the protocol as it operates as a high level layer between the protocol and the client. Patient users also don’t need to care about smart contracts, transaction fee’s etc. It auto adjusts the price paid for gas depending on the level of congestion on the blockchain.</p>
<h4 id='honest'>Honest</h4>
<p>Honest is a public API that allows any kind of application to look up information on the protocol. Anything that resides on the protocol can be seen and consumed by Honest.</p>
<h4 id='modest'>Modest</h4>
<p>The last, and largest of our virtue services. Modest, as the name suggests, is our scaling solution for the blockchain, but firstly for the Aventus Protocol itself. It utilises Merkle trees to allow much quicker, concurrent processing of objects to the blockchain.</p>
<h3 id='aws-lambdas'>AWS Lambdas</h3>
<p>We employ the use of AWS Lambdas throughout the technology stack as serverless middleware between services. These aren&#39;t distinct services themselves but simply allow for horizontally scalable data processing throughout the system.</p>
<h3 id='ticket-wallet'>Ticket Wallet</h3>
<p>The Aventus Ticket Wallet is a white-label mobile application acting as the user facing client for loading and viewing tickets issued by the event creator. Originally designed as a proof-of-concept to show our end-to-end solution including access control but is built in a modular fashion to allow third parties to brand their own wallet using our technology under the hood.</p>

<p>This API documentation aims to make interacting the the Aventus Protocol as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<h1 id='before-you-begin'>Before You Begin</h1>
<p>This guide acts as developer reference for integrating with Aventus Protocol RESTful API covering interaction with events and tickets hence any language and instructional information assumes an existing technical knowledge of interacting via an API and the typical practices involved.</p>

<p>By sending HTTPS requests to specific URLs (endpoints) as a registered user you can easily harness the power of the Aventus Protocol allowing us to handle any corresponding complexity with writing and reading the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

<p>An API endpoint contains the URL of the resource that you want to access and the action that you want to complete on that resource. The action is indicated by the HTTP method of the request: GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE.</p>

<p>When you send an API request, the server returns an HTTP response. The HTTP response contains a status code to indicate whether the request succeeded and the details of the response in the response body. Most resources format this response as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). You can use the JSON packages or libraries that are built in to the programming language that you use to extract the data.</p>
<h1 id='authentication'>Authentication</h1>
<p>All requests to the Aventus APIs go over the web. Essentially this means that any system that can speak to the web, can speak to our APIs. Any and all language specific libraries and SDKs provided are really just wrappers which are providing some convenience and linguistic niceties to help you work with a simple, RESTful API.</p>

<p>Aventus will create an Auth0 login for you to use, and thereafter: the Aventus API requires a header authorisation key/value pair for each request.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To authorize, use this code:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="highlight shell tab-shell"><code><span class="c"># With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request</span>
curl <span class="s2">"api_endpoint_here"</span>
  -H <span class="s2">"Authorization: ticketticket"</span>
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Make sure to replace <code>ticketticket</code> with your API key.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aventus expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:</p>

<p><code>Authorization: ticketticket</code></p>

<aside class="notice">
As of now, there is no need to authenticate. Please see this section in the future for authentication details.

<h1 id='getting-started'>Getting Started</h1>
<p>If this is your first time here, scan this section before digging deeper into the documentation. The sections after this page assume you know the basics about the Aventus Protocol. For further information, read our Whitepaper <a href="https://aventus.io/doc/whitepaper.pdf">here</a> or for a shorter read, our Lightpaper is <a href="https://aventus.io/doc/lightpaper.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>What you can do?</p>

<li>Create an Event (POST)</li>
<li>Retrieve Event List (GET)</li>
<li>Delete Event (DELETE)</li>
<li>Create Tickets (POST)</li>
<li>Retrieve Ticket List (GET)</li>

<h1 id='api-guides'>API Guides</h1>
<p>Aventus makes creating and managing events and tickets on the blockchain easy. Find the documentation, sample code, and developer tools you need to build exactly what you want, fast. We’ll handle the complexity of blockchain and the Aventus Protocol. Let’s get building!</p>
<h2 id='create-event'>Create Event</h2>
<p>The first thing we&#39;d recommend you do is create an event. Events are the foundation of any content on the Aventus Protocol and must be in place before tickets can be issued and thus comes first in this guided flow.</p>

<p>Using our Aventus RESTful API, you can create events on the protocol direct from your language of choice. In this guide, we&#39;ll explore how you can use the Aventus API to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a new event</li>
<li>Set parameters for your event</li>
</ul>

<p>First, take note of the method, and sample request. In this example guide you&#39;ll be creating your new event for 8000 people.</p>
<h3 id='method-post'>Method: <code>POST</code></h3>
<p><code>POST /events</code></p>

<li><strong>Libraries</strong> in Ethereum are special types of contract which do not store data and cannot hold <em>ether</em>. They are are only required to be deployed once and their functions can then be called by any <em>smart contract</em> via <em>delegate calls</em>. <a href="https://blog.aragon.one/library-driven-development-in-solidity-2bebcaf88736">More info</a></li>

<li><strong>Merkle Tree</strong> is a tree constructed by <em>hashing</em> paired binary data (the leaves), then pairing and <em>hashing</em> the results until a single hash remains, which is known as the merkle root. A possible solution for blockchain transaction scaling. Our implementation is our newest virtue service: Modest.</li>
<li><strong>Modest</strong> The name of our Merkle Tree based scaling solution, see above.</li>
<li><strong>Reveal Period</strong> is the 1 week time slot following a <em>Voting Period</em> at the end of the proposal process where the <em>Aventus Community</em> can reveal their vote by re-submitting a secret signed <em>vote</em> on a <em>Governance Proposal</em> or <em>Event Challenge</em>. Once all votes have been revealed then the proposal process can be concluded and <em>vote</em> <em>stakes</em> are tallied to decide a winner</li>
<li><strong>Rinkeby</strong> is our public test Ethereum network for the Protocol</li>
<li><strong>Solidity</strong> is a contract-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts that runs on <em>EVM Code</em>. <a href="http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/">More info</a></li>

<li><strong>Stake Fund</strong> is the section in the voting wallet <em>ÐApp</em> that holds AVT <em>stake</em></li>
<li><strong>Ticket</strong> is a unique identifier assigned to the purchaser of a <em>ticket</em> (ticket owner) that allows access to an <em>event (aventus)</em> which will have an allocation (eg. row and seat number) and price properties describing it&#39;s transfer conditions</li>
<li><strong>Vote</strong> the <em>Aventus Community</em> can vote during a <em>challenge proposal</em> or <em>governance proposal</em> by laying down a <em>stake</em> of AVT with their vote choice</li>
<li><strong>Voting Period</strong> is the 1 week time slot following a <em>Lobbying Period</em> during the proposal process where the <em>Aventus Community</em> can submit secret signed <em>votes</em> on a <em>Governance Proposal</em> or <em>Event Challenge</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='roles'>Roles</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Event Owner</strong> The registered event owner. The only one who can create or cancel an event and the only one who can register/deregister roles on the event. Can also sell, resell or return (refund) tickets. Can also act as a <em>broker</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Primary</strong> A ticket vendor for the primary market (initial ticket sales), registered on the event. Can also act as a <em>broker</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Secondary</strong> A third party ticket reseller for the secondary market (secondhand tickets for resale), registered on the event. Can also act as a <em>broker</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Vendor</strong> Primary market ticket seller: either a <em>primary</em> or an <em>event owner</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Reseller</strong> Secondary market ticket reseller: either a <em>secondary</em> or an <em>event owner</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Ticket Owner</strong> The owner of the ticket. Initially the buyer but from there on always the person who could currently attend the event, as the ticket changes states from owned to listed to resold/transferred etc</li>
<li><strong>Friend</strong> Someone trusted by the <em>ticket owner</em> they are willing to transfer the <em>door data</em> to.</li>
<li><strong>Broker</strong> Able to interact with the protocol on behalf of any of the above roles (<em>event owner, ticket owner, primary, secondary</em>). If they have individually granted them permission via the correct proof. Can (optionally) be registered on an event. Must be registered if they&#39;re dealing with blank tickets or transferring tickets.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id='scaling'>Scaling</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Merkle Tree</strong> A tree data structure constructed by hashing the leaves, then packing leaves pair-wise  and hashing the results until a single hash remains, which is known as the <em>merkle root</em>. This is the basis of our solution for blockchain scaling. It is the latest virtue service named Modest.</li>
<li><strong>Merkle Leaf</strong> Data in a merkle leaf - this is hashed when used in the proof. Existence of a leaf in a <em>merkle tree</em> can be efficiently computed from the leaf and a <em>Merkle Path (Merkle Proof)</em>. is a tuple of LeafContent and id.</li>
<li><strong>Merkle Leaf Data</strong> the ordered leaf contents to create the merkle leaf hash: <code>(eventId, vendorTicketRefHash, ticketMetadata, ticketOwner, listTicketVendorProof, doorData)</code></li>
<li><strong>Merkle Root</strong> The final hash generated by hashing each level of the tree which is the only thing being added to the blockchain in the scaling case</li>
<li><strong>Merkle Path</strong> Array of all the sibling hashes between the leaf and the root (excludes the <em>leaf hash</em> and <em>root hash</em> themselves)</li>
<li><strong>Merkle Proof</strong> An abstract term, the means of proving a <em>merkle leaf</em>&#39;s inclusion in the <em>merkle tree</em>. Calculated from the leaf hash, the merkle path, and the merkle root. In the protocol the merkle path and components of the merkle leaf data are passed separately, the merkle leaf hash is then generated, and the merkle root is calculated from the merkle path and merkle leaf hash and then checked against its registered existence in the blockchain. This is used to efficiently prove a ticket has been registered in the blockchain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id='ids'>IDs</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vendor Ticket Ref</strong> External reference unique to that particular <em>vendor</em> for that particular event.</li>
<li><strong>VendorTicketRefHash</strong> The vendor ticket ref is passed in hashed, it is then appended with the vendor address and hashed again to ensure uniqueness across vendors, before being cast into the protocol <em>Ticket ID</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Ticket ID</strong> A unique ticket reference for each ticket made up of the <em>VendorTicketRefHash</em> and the vendor address to ensure proper uniqueness across multiple <em>primary</em> vendors. In a uint256 format.</li>
<li><strong>Event ID</strong> A unique (always incrementing) ID number associated with each event that is assigned by the Protocol. Globally unique across the protocol and all events to ever exist in it - nothing to do with any external event ID a particular event owner might use</li>
<li><strong>Key Pair 1</strong> public and private key of <em>ticket owner</em>, generated by wallet, only used for proof of ownership to blockchain (and proof at door if AC is integrated)</li>
<li><strong>Key Pair 2</strong> public and private key of <em>ticket owner</em>, generated by wallet, used for proof of ticket at the door in the non-integrated AC scenarios</li>
</ul>
<h2 id='signed-proofs-currently-under-construction'>Signed Proofs (currently under construction)</h2>

<h2 id='tickets'>Tickets</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sell Ticket</strong> Initial creation of a ticket</li>
<li><strong>Resell Ticket</strong> Change the ownership of a ticket</li>
<li><strong>Cancel Ticket</strong> Cancels a ticket</li>
<li><strong>Onsale</strong> The time at which tickets are available to buy from a <em>primary</em> or be resold via the secondary market.</li>
<li><strong>Offsale</strong> The time at which tickets are no longer available to buy from a <em>primary</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Ticket Metadata</strong> Data points associated with tickets that are not required by the protocol, like; venue, event time, seat number, etc</li>
<li><strong>Door Data</strong> The piece of data only known by the <em>primary</em> and the <em>ticket holder</em> used to derive the valid public key associated with a ticket at the door. The secret is signed twice - by the primary then by the ticket owner - and stored on the blockchain in this state so it is obscured unless EC Recovered by the relevant parties.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id='ticket-statuses'>Ticket Statuses</h2><h3 id='event-based'>Event Based</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pending</strong> Time-Based State: When a ticket holder initially purchases their ticket and clicks the link sent to them via email the wallet will load up a ticket whilst the ticket in an initial state while it is being added to a Merkle tree. This &#39;Pending&#39; state is not clickable and remains until the Merkle proof is returned from Modest</li>
<li><strong>Ready</strong> Time-Based State: Once the Merkle proof is returned to the wallet the ticket enters a &#39;Ready&#39; state where it also becomes &#39;Actionable&#39; (see Action-Based States). This state is the default normal time-based state of a ticket and remains in place until X hours before the event</li>
<li><strong>Active</strong> Time-Based State: X hours before the event the ticket enters an &#39;Active&#39; state in which the QR code becomes visible and can be used for access control</li>
<li><strong>Expired</strong> Time-Based State: X hours after the event time the ticket enters an &#39;Expired&#39; inactive state in which the ticket cannot be interacted with. The ticket remains in a visible state as a history for the user</li>
</ul>
<h3 id='ticket-based'>Ticket Based</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actionable</strong> Action-Based State: A ticket is in an &#39;Actionable&#39; state once it has reached a &#39;Ready&#39; time-based state (ie. it is fully loaded into the wallet), which means actions can be taken on it (List for Resale, Transfer, etc). This is the default normal action-based state of a ticket and remains in place for the tickets lifespan</li>
<li><strong>Listing</strong> Action-Based State: Once a user enacts the &#39;List for Resale&#39; function on a ticket the ticket enters a loading state whilst behind the scenes the ticket is being listed on the blockchain from a merkle tree</li>
<li><strong>Listed</strong> Action-Based State: Once the ticket has been copied over to the blockchain from a merkle tree the ticket enters a &#39;Listed&#39; state meaning it&#39;s ready to post with a secondary</li>
<li><strong>Posting</strong> Action-Based State: Once a user enacts the &#39;List for Resale&#39; function on a ticket the ticket enters a loading state whilst behind the scenes the ticket is being listed with the secondary. This step can only take place once the ticket has been &#39;Listed&#39; on the blockchain</li>
<li><strong>Posted</strong> Action-Based State: Once the ticket has been posted on a secondary market site the ticket enters a &#39;Posted&#39; state until someone purchases it via the secondary</li>
<li><strong>Confirm Resale</strong> Action-Based State: Once the secondary finds a buyer for the ticket, they communicate this back to the seller at which point the sellers wallet prompts the user to approve the resale</li>
<li><strong>Sold</strong> Action-Based State: Once someone buys the listed ticket via the secondary and the sale is approved by the seller, the ticket enters a &#39;Sold&#39; inactive state in which the ticket cannot be interacted with. The ticket remains in a greyed out visible state as a history for the user</li>
</ul>
<h2 id='events'>Events</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>eventDesc</strong> A human readable string associated with an event to act as a descriptive title for that event, eg. &quot;Adele at Wembley Stadium&quot;, which is used alongside other parameters (eventSupportURL,onSaleTime, offSaleTime) to create a unique reference for the event</li>
<li><strong>Non-existent</strong> Never existed or has been completely shut down via failing a challenge or ending naturally</li>
<li><strong>Reporting</strong> Before the &quot;on-sale&quot; period; waiting for a potential challenge</li>
<li><strong>Trading</strong> in the &quot;on-sale&quot; period</li>
<li><strong>Inactive</strong> After sales period, waiting for endEvent to be called in order to release the deposit: a.k.a. Z O M B I E event</li>
