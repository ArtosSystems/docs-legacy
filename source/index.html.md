title = What we see in the title bar in a browser
language_tabs = What we display in the top right for language toggles, if we add a new language, we should add it to the tab and it'll deal with it.
toc_footers = the bottom left links, maybe add contact?
includes = the actual contents, nothing is here anymore, but these are the order they display in the left bar
