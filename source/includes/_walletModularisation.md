# Ticket Wallet Modules

As described in the [Introduction](#introduction), our reference application Ticket Wallet is built in a modularised fashion allowing clients to select the parts they need to achieve the functionality required for their product. This section includes the core wallet functionality as well as a full list of our available modules. The list is not exhaustive and in constant development so if there's something specific you're looking for feel free to contact Artos directly and we can discuss what your needs may be for future development.

Today, the following modules are available to you:

Wallet Core:

- Receiving/Displaying Tickets
- Create Ticket SDK

Wallet Optional:

- Secondary Market functionality
- Gift Ticket functionality
- Dynamic QR Code
- Key Pair Management (upcoming)
- Secure Pin Entry (upcoming)
- On-boarding (upcoming)

When thinking about the wallet, consider the following options for delivery:

1. Our App (the white label app Artos deliver to the app stores)
  - **Our App, Our Modules**
  - AVT Capable Wallet
  - Delivers minimum viable ticket
1. Your App (client app within the app stores)
  - 2a. **Your app, our modules**
  - 2b. **Your app, your modules, our modules**
  - 2c. **Your app, your modules, our SDK**

The guiding principle is that you may either want to theme a version of our wallet (see option 2a) or use a version of our wallet with modules (potential existing functionality you have built for your own applications previously, or expertise which is held by your own development team) you may want to build yourself (2b/c). Or, you might just want to use our own wallet with no additional functionality to consume tickets (1).

All of our modules will have preset UI/UX requirements and outputs, limited to specific communication with other modules that will be clearly defined.

As a further note on modularisation of our apps, we will in the future modularise the single door version of the Access Control Solution SDK.

As of now, this section is still under construction, we will return to this as we approach full modularisation of our Ticket Wallet application.
