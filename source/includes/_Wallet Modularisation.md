# Wallet Modularisation

As described above, the Wallet is built in a modularised fashion for clients to select the parts they need to achieve the functionality required for their product. This list is not exhaustive, and upon contacting Artos, we can discuss what your needs may be for future development.

Today, the following functions are available to you:
- Recieving/Displaying Tickets
- Secondary Market functionality
- Gift Ticket functionality

As of now, this section is a placeholder, we will return to this as we approach modularisation of our Ticket Wallet product.
