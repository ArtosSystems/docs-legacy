# Wallet Modularisation

As described above, the Wallet is built in a modularised fashion for clients to select the parts they need to achieve the functionality required for their product. This list is not exhaustive, and upon contacting Artos, we can discuss what your needs may be for future development.

Today, the following functions are available to you:

Wallet Core:

- Recieving/Displaying Tickets
- Create Ticket SDK
- Key Pair Management

Wallet Optional:

- Secondary Market functionality
- Gift Ticket functionality
- Dynamic QR Code
- Secure Pin Entry (tbc)
- Onboarding (tbc)

When thinking about the wallet, consider the following options for delivery:

1. Our App (the white label app Artos deliver to the app stores)
  - **Our App, Our Modules**
  - AVT Capable Wallet
  - Delivers minimum viable ticket
1. Your App (client app within the app stores)
  - 2a. **Your app, our modules**
  - 2b. **Your app, your modules, our modules**
  - 2c. **Your app, your modules, our SDK**

All of our modules will have preset UI/UX requirements.

We will in the future moddularise the single door version of the Access Control Solution SDK.
