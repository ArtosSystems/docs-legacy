# Introduction

We have developed the Aventus Protocol on behalf of the Aventus Foundation.

Below you will find a general architecture diagram outlining our core services and where data is being processed from the point of entry via our RESTful API. Each of these distinct services makes up the Artos Systems ecosystem and we aim to continue to development on these technologies as our implementation matures.

As shown in the above architecture diagram our technology stack is built in layers on top of the Ethereum blockchain and each product serves a purpose to ensure interaction via our endpoints is standardised and familiar for developers.

### Aventus Protocol

The Aventus Protocol is a global open standard for the exchange of tickets built upon the blockchain composed of smart contracts that allow for the creation and validation of events, the issuance and distribution of tickets in primary and secondary ticket markets. For more information, please refer to our [Whitepaper](https://aventus.io/doc/whitepaper.pdf) - or for a shorter read, our [Lightpaper](https://aventus.io/doc/lightpaper.pdf).

### Protocol Abstraction

We have developed a family of services within the Artos ecosystem that help deal with the inherent challenges of blockchain technology including scalability, gas efficiency and transparency. Our 'virtue' services are outlined below:

#### Patient

Patient is a data queuing system for the blockchain. It acts as a way to manage a series of large write requests to ensure that transactions are sent to Ethereum in a gas efficient manner based on the priority of the data sent. If the network is congested, Patient will hold off writing any low priority transactions until the gas price is more suitable (and vice versa). Any transaction data ultimately generated by our API will be routed through Patient to write it to the Ethereum blockchain.

#### Honest

Honest is a publicly accessible history of transactions on the Protocol implemented as an API that allows any service to look up information. Each time a transaction is made, Honest reads any Solidity logs emitted to compile a complete and queryable history of data written to the blockchain via the Protocol. The nature of an open blockchain means that data is available to everyone and immutable, but our read service Honest makes this data more accessible than a direct read query to Ethereum.

#### Modest

Because the Ethereum blockchain has some issues with scaling we've built our own Merkle Tree based solution named Modest for use with the Protocol. It allows for large quantities of ticket data to be sent to the blockchain en masse in the form of Merkle Roots.

<aside class="notice">In the future we will add a specification for Modest here, and also a deeper explanation of how it works and how you can roll your own solution.</aside>

#### AWS Lambdas

We employ the use of AWS Lambdas throughout the technology stack as serverless middleware between services. These aren't distinct services themselves but simply allow for horizontally scalable data processing throughout the system.

#### API Gateways

The API is the core service developers will be interacting with when utilising the Aventus Protocol. We have provided a RESTful interface to give you easy access to the various functions of the Protocol and will continue to update these endpoints when new methods are added. For more information see the [API Guides](#api-guides) section below.

#### SDKs

Including, but not exhaustive: Aventus4S - our Scala library for interacting with the protocol, and AventusJS - our Javascript library for interacting with the protocol. As we develop more SDKs, we will insert them here and in the relevant sub section.

### B2B/B2C Applications

#### White-Label Ticket Wallet

The Aventus Ticket Wallet is a white-label mobile application acting as the user facing client for loading and viewing tickets issued by the event creator. Originally designed as a proof-of-concept to show our end-to-end solution including access control, but built in a modular fashion to allow third parties to brand their own wallet using Protocol-compatible technology under the hood.

##### Wallet Modules

As mentioned the wallet has been built to make sure features are bundled in modules meaning they can be added/removed without affecting the core functionality of the app (loading and displaying Aventus Protocol tickets). This modularity means a third party doesn't necessarily need to build their own version of the wallet _or_ use ours wholesale. This is covered in more depth in the [Ticket Wallet Modules](#ticket-wallet-modules) to be found below.

#### METaL App

METaL is our protocol-level interface client allowing specified users to create and manage events, tickets and links on the Aventus Protocol. It provides a simple front end reference interface for users not willing to directly integrate with the API layer outlined above. For more information, see the [METaL](#metal) section of this portal.

# Before You Begin

This guide acts as developer reference for integrating with Aventus Protocol RESTful API covering interaction with events and tickets, hence any language and instructional information assumes an existing technical knowledge of interacting via an API and the typical practices involved.

By sending HTTPS requests to specific URLs (endpoints) as a registered user you can easily harness the power of the Aventus Protocol allowing us to handle any corresponding complexity related to writing and reading the Ethereum blockchain.

An API endpoint contains the URL of the resource that you want to access and the action that you want to complete on that resource. The action is indicated by the HTTP method of the request: GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE.

When you send an API request, the server returns a HTTP response. The HTTP response contains a status code to indicate whether the request succeeded and the details of the response in the response body. Most resources format this response as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). You can use the JSON packages or libraries that are built in to the programming language that you use to extract the data.
