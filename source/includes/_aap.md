# The Agency Admin Panel

As described above; The Agency Admin Panel is our protocol level interface for clients to create and manage events that will be delivered with the assistance of the Aventus Protocol. It provides a simple front end interface which enables users to create events and manage events, add tickets, cancel tickets and distribute them to event attendees. Finally, it also allows users to generate a doorlist for access control purposes.
